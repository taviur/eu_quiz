#'debug = True' allows it to update itself without you having to re-run it in the terminal/shell
#port=xxxx changes the port so that you would now find the page at: http://127.0.0.1:3672/ <-- for example.
#app.run() needs to go after all the functions, otherwise the functions will not be run!
app.run(
	debug=True, port=3672)
